# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the ride-sharing data by city type
Using Pandas and Matplotlib, I was to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Resources
- Data Source: ride_data.csv, city_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.7 with Anaconda running Jupyter Notebook

## Results
The differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types can be seen by the PyBer DataFrame below:

![](/Analysis/Pyber_df.png)

Total rides, total drivers, and total fares increase as we go from rural to urban. Average fair per ride and average fair per driver meanwhile decrease from rural to urban. 

The data can also be depicted by looking at a line graph that best visualizes the differences by city type for total fares:

## Summary
Based on these results, I would provide three business recommendations to the CEO for disparities among city types.
1. Prioritize expansion of drivers in rural and suburban regions as there is potential additional profit to be made from here as there is currently a low amount of drivers there compared to the urban region. It is true that demand may not be the same in those regions but it would be something to consider as those regions make much better fares currently.
2. As there is quite the disparity in fares in the regions, perhaps set up a pass of some sort that could provide similar costs wherever the person may be by starting a membership service. Subscription services serve to get retention in clients.
3. Focus on providing incentives for more drivers to provide more rides, the more that regular folks do rides for customers, the better the clients may feel about customer service. The rural areas currently have drivers provide more rides than in urban areas.
